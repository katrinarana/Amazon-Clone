# Amazon-Clone

This is my first project as a beginner where I attempted to create a simple clone of Amazon's website using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice basic web development skills, including layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## Features
**Home Page Layout**: Replicates Amazon's homepage structure with header, search bar, and footer.
**Product Listings**: Basic product grid with images, descriptions, and prices.
**Navigation Bar**: Functional navbar with Amazon-like categories and search functionality.
**Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

## Technologies Used
**HTML**: For the structure and layout of the website.
**CSS**: For styling, layout, and responsive design.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.
- Learned how to structure a webpage similar to a real-world website.
- Practiced responsive web design techniques.

## Future Improvements
- Adding JavaScript for interactive features like a functional cart or product filtering.
